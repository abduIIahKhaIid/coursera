# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

This Jupyter Notebook contains an overview of **Data Science Tools** and the **Ecosystem** used in data science workflows. The content of this notebook includes:

- An introduction to data science tools and technologies.
- A list of popular programming languages and libraries used in the field of data science.
- A table of open-source tools commonly used for development in data science.
- Examples of performing arithmetic operations in Python.

### Key Features:
- **Markdown Cells** for explanations and descriptions.
- **Code Cells** to demonstrate arithmetic operations and data transformations.
- **Visualizations** created using different libraries.

### Files:
- **DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb**: The main notebook file containing the project.
- **Screenshots**: Various screenshots showing the output of different exercises.
